##  1. Algorithm overview 

   The Poisson surface reconstruction method commonly used in PCL is limited in practical application due to its high computational complexity and low algorithm efficiency. In order to change this situation, the algorithm was optimized in PCL 1.13.0 version, and multi-threaded parallel was added on the basis of the original algorithm.
