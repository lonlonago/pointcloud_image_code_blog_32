#  Data or field connection 

 1. Data connection: Connect two different point clouds to the same point cloud. Before performing the connection operation, ensure that the fields in the two datasets have the same type and equal dimensions. Example 1: 

  ```python

 2. Field connection: For the connection of two fields (e.g. color, normal) with different point clouds, there is a mandatory constraint that the number of points in the two datasets must be the same.
