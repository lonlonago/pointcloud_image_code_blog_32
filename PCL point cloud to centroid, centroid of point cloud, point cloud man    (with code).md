#  I. Overview 

   Point cloud de-centroid is an important step in computing point cloud covariance. Find out the out-point cloud centroid point, subtract the coordinates of the centroid point from each point, and finally save it as point cloud data. It can play a role in hiding the real coordinate information of the point cloud. It is used in SVD transformation matrix, principal component analysis covariance matrix and other operations. 

#  Second, the main function 

 PCL :: de mean Point Cloud () subtracts a centroid from the point cloud and returns the result of de-averaging
